We populated this sacred Mother Earth with different faces,   and since that time we have understood the plurality that exists in all things and in our diversity as human beings and cultures.  Thus,   our peoples were formed,   and we never knew racism until we were subjected to it during the terrible times of colonialism.

Peoples Republic of Korea 2016,"Preamble, Reference to country's history, Political theorists/figuresPreambleThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the socialist motherland of Juche where the ideas and leadership of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are applied. The great Comrade Kim Il Sung was the founder of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the father of socialist Korea. Comrade Kim Il Sung authored the immortal Juche idea and,  by organizing and leading the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle under its banner,  created the glorious revolutionary traditions and achieved the historic cause of national restoration.  He laid solid foundations for the building of an independent and sovereign State in the political,  economic,  cultural and military fields,  and based on them,  founded the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Having put forward Juche-oriented revolutionary lines,  Comrade Kim Il Sung wisely led various stages of social revolution and construction work,  thus strengthening and developing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea into a socialist country centred on the masses,  into a socialist State which is independent,  self-sufficient and self-reliant in defence. Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated the fundamental principles governing the building and activities of the State,  established an ideal State and social system,  an ideal mode of politics and an ideal system and ideal methods for administering society,  and laid solid foundations for the prosperity of the socialist motherland and for the inheritance and completion of the revolutionary cause of Juche. The great Comrade Kim Jong Il was a peerless patriot and defender of socialist Korea who,  true to the ideas and cause of Comrade Kim Il Sung,  strengthened and developed the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea into Kim Il Sung’s State and placed the dignity and power of the nation on the highest ever plane. Comrade Kim Jong Il developed in depth and in an all-round way the immortal Juche idea and Songun idea authored by Comrade Kim Il Sung,  further perfecting them as ideas guiding the era of independence,  and ensured the continuity of the Korean revolution by firmly defending the revolutionary traditions of Juche and carrying them forward in their purity and entirety. In the face of the collapse of the world socialist system and the vicious offensive of the imperialist allied forces to stifle the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,  Comrade Kim Jong Il administered Songun politics;  thus he safeguarded with honour the achievements of socialism which are the precious legacy of Comrade Kim Il Sung,  developed the DPRK into an invincible politico-ideological power,  a nuclear state and an unchallengeable military power,  and opened a broad avenue for the building of a powerful socialist country. God or other deitiesRegarding “The people are my God” as their maxim,  Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il always mixed with the people,  devoted their whole lives to them and turned the whole of society into a large family which is united in one mind by taking care of the people and leading them through their noble benevolent politics. The great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are the sun of the nation and the lodestar of national reunification.  Regarding the reunification of the country as the supreme national task,  they devoted all their efforts and care for its realization.  They made the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea a powerful bastion for national reunification.  At the same time,  they set out the fundamental principle and ways of achieving national reunification and developed the movement for national reunification into a nationwide movement,  opening the way for completing the cause of reunification through the united efforts of the whole nation. The great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il clarified the basic ideals of the foreign policy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  On the basis of this,  they expanded and developed the country’s foreign relations and ensured that the international prestige of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was exalted.  As veteran world statesmen,  they opened up a new era of independence,  carried out energetic activities for strengthening and developing the socialist movement and the non-aligned movement,  as well as for world peace and for friendship among peoples,  and made an imperishable contribution to the cause of human independence. Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il were geniuses of ideology and theory,  masters of the leadership art,  ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commanders,  great revolutionaries and statesmen,  and great men. The great ideas of Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il and the great achievements made under their leadership are the lasting treasures of the Korean revolution and the basic guarantee for the prosperity of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,  and the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun where Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il are preserved in their lifetime appearance is a grand monument to their immortality and a symbol of the dignity and eternal sanctuary of the entire Korean nation. Preferred political partiesUnder the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea,  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Korean people will uphold the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as the eternal leaders of Juche Korea,  and will carry the revolutionary cause of Juche through to completion by defending and carrying forward their ideas and achievements. The Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea shall,  as the codification of the Juche-oriented ideas of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on State building and their exploits in it,  be called Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il Constitution.

Thailand 2017,"Motives for writing constitution, Preamble, Source of constitutional authorityPreambleMay there be virtue.  Today is the tenth day of the waxing moon in the fifth month of the year of the Rooster under the lunar calendar,  being Thursday,  the sixth day of April under the solar calendar,  in the 2560th year of the Buddhist Era. Reference to country's historyHis Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun is graciously pleased to proclaim that the Prime Minister has respectfully informed that since Phrabat Somdet Phra Paramintharamaha Prajadhipok Phra Pokklao Chaoyuhua graciously granted the Constitution of the Kingdom of Siam,  B. E.  2475 (1932),  Thailand has continuously and always maintained the intention to adhere to a democratic regime of government with the King as Head of State.  Even though Constitutions have been annulled,  amended and promulgated on several occasions to suitably reorganise governance,  there was still no stability or order due to various problems and conflicts.  At times,  those events degenerated into Constitutional crises which cannot be resolved.  This was partially caused by there being persons ignoring or disobeying governance rules of the country,  being corrupt and fraudulent,  abusing power,  and lacking a sense of responsibility towards the nation and the people,  resulting in the ineffective enforcement of law.  It is,  therefore,  necessary to prevent and rectify these matters by reforming education and law enforcement,  and strengthening the system of merits and ethics.  Other causes are governance rules which are inappropriate to the situation of the country and the times,  the prioritisation of forms and procedures over basic principles of democracy,  or the failure to effectively apply,  during the crises,  existing rules to individuals’ behaviours and situations,  the forms and procedures of which differ from those of the past. Reference to fraternity/solidarityThe Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand (Interim),  B. E.  2557 (2014) Amendment (No.  1),  B. E.  2558 (2015) accordingly provides that there shall be a Constitution Drafting Committee to draft a Constitution to be used as the principle of governance and as a guide for preparing organic laws and other laws by prescribing new mechanisms to reform and strengthen the governance of the country.  This is to be carried out by:  appropriately restructuring the duties and powers of organs under the Constitution and the relationship between the legislative and executive branches;  enabling Court institutions and other Independent Organs that have duties to scrutinise the exercise of State powers to perform their duties efficiently,  honestly and equitably,  and to participate in preventing or solving national crises,  as necessary and appropriate;  guaranteeing,  safeguarding and protecting Thai people’s rights and liberties more clearly and inclusively by holding that the Thai people’s rights and liberties are the principle,  while the restriction and limitation thereon are exceptions,  provided that the exercise of such rights and liberties must be subject to the rules for protecting the public;  prescribing the duties of the State towards people,  as well as requiring the people to have duties towards the State;  establishing strict and absolute mechanisms to prevent,  examine and eliminate dishonest act and wrongful conduct to prevent executives who lack moral virtue,  ethics and good governance from ruling the country or using power arbitrarily;  prescribing measures to prevent and manage crises in the country more efficiently;  and,  prescribing other mechanisms in accordance with the direction specified by the Constitution of Thailand (Interim),  B. E.  2557 (2014).  These are to be used as a framework for developing the country,  in line with the directive principles of State policies and the National Strategy,  from which each Administration shall prescribe the appropriate policies and implementation.  Additionally,  this establishes mechanisms to work together to reform the country in various aspects that are important and necessary,  as well as to reduce the causes of conflict,  so that the country can be at peace on the basis of unity and solidarity.  The successful implementation of these matters demands cooperation among the people from all parts and all agencies of the State,  in accordance with the direction of the Civil State,  pursuant to the rules under the principles of a democratic regime of government and constitutional conventions that are suited to the situation and the nature of Thai society,  the principles of good faith,  human rights and good governance.  This will in turn drive the country to progressively develop to become stable,  prosperous and sustainable,  politically,  economically and socially,  under the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of State. ReferendaPursuant to the foregoing undertakings,  the Constitution Drafting Committee has periodically imparted knowledge and understanding to the people of the principles and rationale of provisions of the Draft Constitution,  has provided the people opportunities to widely access to the Draft Constitution and its meaning through different media,  and has involved the people in the development of the essence of the Draft Constitution through receiving recommendations on possible revisions.  Once the preparation of the Draft Constitution was complete,  copies of the Draft Constitution and a brief primer were disseminated in a way which allowed the people to easily and generally understand the main provisions of the Draft Constitution,  and a referendum was arranged to approve the entire Draft Constitution.  In this regard,  the National Legislative Assembly also passed a resolution introducing one additional issue to be put to vote in referendum on the same occasion.  The outcome of the referendum was such that people having the right to vote,  by a majority of votes of the people voting in the referendum,  approved such Draft Constitution and additional issue.  The Constitution Drafting Committee accordingly revised the relevant parts of the Draft Constitution to be in accordance with the outcome pertaining to the additional issue of the referendum,  and referred the revision to the Constitutional Court for consideration as to whether it is in conformity with the outcome of the referendum.  The Constitutional Court thereafter rendered a decision for the Constitution Drafting Committee to partially revise the texts.  The Constitution Drafting Committee has made a revision according to the decision of the Constitutional Court.

P,  the Sao Tomean People attained their National Independence and proclaimed before Africa and all Humanity the Democratic Republic of S.  Tome and Principe.  That victory,  the greatest of our History only was possible thanks to the sacrifices and to the determination of valiant sons of S.

Tome and Principe. Inspired by the historic necessity of promoting increasingly broader and responsible participation of the citizen in the various dominions of the national life,  this present revision to the constitutional text,  in addition to consecrating the principle that the monopoly of power does not constitute by itself alone sufficient guarantee of progress,  represents the collective will of the Sao Tomeans in giving their share of contribution to the universality of the fundamental rights and freedoms of mankind.

Source of constitutional authority, Motives for writing constitutionAnd in implementation of the popular will expressed in the principles enshrined in the National Action Charter;  pursuant to the authority entrusted to us by our great people to amend the Constitution;  out of our desire to complete the requirements of the democratic system of government for our beloved nation;  striving for a better future in which the homeland and the citizen will enjoy greater welfare,  progress,  development,  stability and prosperity through earnest and constructive cooperation between government and citizens which will remove the obstacles to progress;  and out of a conviction that the future and working for the future is what all of us seek in the coming state;  and in view of our belief that such an objective requires the exertion of efforts;  and in order to complete the march,  we have amended the existing Constitution. God or other deities, Regional group(s)This amendment has taken account of all the lofty values and the great human principles enshrined in the National Action Charter.  These values and principles confirm that the people of Bahrain surge ahead in their triumphant march towards a bright future,  God willing,  a future in which the efforts of all parties and individuals unite,  and the authorities in their new garb devote themselves to achieve the hopes and aspirations under his tolerant rule,  declaring their adherence to Islam as a faith,  a code of laws and a way of life,  with their affiliation to the great Arab nation,  and their association with the Gulf Cooperation Council now and in the future,  and their striving for everything that will achieve justice,  good and peace for the whole of Mankind. The amendments to the Constitution proceed from the premise that the noble people of Bahrain believe that Islam brings salvation in this world and the next,  and that Islam means neither inertness nor fanaticism but explicitly states that wisdom is the goal of the believer wherever he finds it he should take it,  and that the Qur’an has been remiss in nothing. In order to achieve this goal,  it is essential that we listen and look to the whole of the human heritage in both East and West,  adopting that which we consider to be beneficial and suitable and consistent with our religion,  values and traditions and is appropriate to our circumstances,  in the conviction that social and human systems are not inflexible tools and instruments which can be moved unchanged from place to place,  but are messages conveyed to the mind,  spirit and conscience of man and are influenced by his reactions and their circumstances of his society. Type of government envisionedThus these constitutional amendments are representative of the advanced cultural thought of our beloved nation.  They base our political system on a constitutional monarchy founded on counsel [shura],  which in Islam is the highest model for governance,  and on the people’s participation in the exercise of power,  which is the foundation of modern political thought.  The Ruler,  with his perspicacity,  chooses certain experienced people to constitute the Consultative Council (Majlis al-Shura),  and the aware,  free and loyal people choose through elections those who make up the Chamber of Deputies (Majlis al-Nuwwab),  and thus the two chambers together achieve the popular will represented by the National Assembly (Al-Majlis al-Watani). Motives for writing constitutionThese constitutional amendments undoubtedly reflect the joint will of the King and the people,  and achieve for everyone the lofty ideals and the great humanitarian principles contained in the National Action Charter,  and ensure that the people will advance to the high position for which their ability and preparedness qualify them,  and which accords with the greatness of their history,  and allows them to occupy their appropriate place among the civilized nations of the world. This Constitution that we have promulgated contains the amendments that have carried out in accordance with the provisions of the National Action Charter and that complement all the unamended texts. We have attached an explanation memorandum which will be used to explain its judgment. "
Algeria 2020,"Reference to country's history, Motives for writing constitution, PreamblePreambleThe Algerian people are a free people;  and they are resolved to remain so. Human dignityStretching back over thousands of years,  their history is marked by a progression of exertion and struggle that has turned Algeria into an everlasting seedbed of freedom and a land of glory and dignity. Ever since the Numidian era and the Islamic Conquest,  and up until the wars of liberation against colonialism,  Algeria has always known at the epic moments witnessed in the Mediterranean basin how to find amongst her children pioneers of freedom,  unity and progress,  as well as builders of prosperous democratic states throughout the epochs of grandeur and peace. The 1st November 1954 was a turning point in determining her future and a tremendous crowning of a ferocious resistance during which she withstood the diverse onslaughts on her culture and values,  as well as the fundamental constituents of her identity,  namely Islam,  Arabism and Amazighism that the State has been relentlessly endeavouring to promote and develop each one of them;  the roots of her current exertion in the various domains stretch back to the glorious past of her Nation. The Algerian people rallied round the national movement and subsequently the National Liberation Front,  and made the ultimate sacrifice in order to assume their collective destiny under the banner of their recovered freedom and national cultural identity and to build their authentic people’s constitutional institutions. Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front and the National Liberation Army,  the Algerian people crowned what their preeminent children made in terms of ultimate sacrifices during the people’s war of liberation with independence,  and built a modern and fully sovereign state. The Algerian people were determined to achieve a host of momentous victories marked by the reclaiming of national riches and the making of a state devoted exclusively to serving the masses,  thus strengthening the legitimacy of the state that exercises its powers in the service of national independence and free of any foreign pressure. The Algerian people’s resistance to violent attempts that threaten the unity and stability of the state has strengthened their adherence to the values of tolerance and peace.  They decided,  thanks to their unwavering belief and adherence to their unity,  and in full sovereignty,  to implement the Peace and National Reconciliation policy,  which has yielded fruit that they are determined to preserve. Reference to fraternity/solidarityThe Algerian people shall be determined to keep Algeria immune from Fitna,  violence and all forms of extremism,  including hate speech and all forms of discrimination,  by establishing their spiritual and civilisational values which call for dialogue,  reconciliation and fraternity within the framework of respect for the Constitution and the laws of the Republic. The Algerian people express their eagerness to translate their aspirations in this Constitution to profound social transformations to build a new Algeria,  which have been expressed peacefully since the launch of the popular movement on 22 February 2019,  in full unity with its People’s National Army. The Algerian people have always been struggling for freedom and democracy and they are resolved to uphold their national sovereignty and independence.  With this Constitution,  they are determined to establish a host of institutions based on the participation of every single Algerian man and woman in conducting public affairs and the capacity to achieve social justice,  equality and freedom for everyone within the framework of a democratic and republican state.  The Constitution aspires to be the appropriate framework for strengthening national ties and guaranteeing democratic freedoms for citizens. Regional group(s), International organizationsAlgeria expresses its commitment to work to prevent and combat corruption as enshrined in the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption of 11 July 2003,  the United Nations Convention against Corruption of 31 October 2003,  and the Arab Convention to Fight Corruption of 21 December 2010. By approving this Constitution,  which is the manifestation of their proper genius,  the reflection of their aspirations,  the fruit of their determination and the outcome of the profound social mutations they have occasioned,  the Algerian people shall substantiate with full appreciation and resoluteness more than ever before the ascendancy of the law. The Constitution stands above all;  it shall be the fundamental law safeguarding the individual and collective rights and freedoms.

Cape Verde 1992,"Preamble, Reference to country's historyPreambleThe Proclamation of National Independence is one of the supreme moments in the History of the Cape Verdian nation,  resulting in the revitalization of our people,  who have undergone the same vicissitudes of fate but who share the persistent hope of creating in these islands proper living conditions for all of our children.  Independence has also allowed Cape Verde to become a full member of the international community. However,  the affirmation of an independent state was not accompanied by the establishment of a regime characterized by pluralistic democracy,  but rather the organization of political power was subject to the philosophy and principles of a single party. The exercise of power in this framework has demonstrated,  on a universal scale,  the necessity of introducing profound changes in the organization of the political and social life of these States.  New ideas assail the world,  destroying structures and concepts which seemed solidly established,  completely changing the course of international political events. In Cape Verde,  political opening was announced in 1990,  with the creation of the institutional conditions required for the first presidential and legislative elections within the framework of political competition. Thus,  on September 28,  the National Popular Assembly approved Constitutional Law No.  2/III/90,  which,  in revoking Article 4 of the Constitution and establishing the principle of pluralism,  created a new type of political regime. Conceived as a means to revitalize democratic elections and a transition towards a new model for the organization of the political and social life of the country,  it also established a different system of government and another form of suffrage,  in view of imminent elections for a new legislative assembly. It was in this context that the first legislative elections took place in January 1991,  followed by Presidential elections in February.  The participation of the population in these elections demonstrated clearly the country's option in the direction of change of political regime. However,  the historical context in which,  by means of a partial revision of the Constitution,  parties were recognized as the principal instruments for the formation of political will in government,  has led to a pluralistic democracy which continues to function under the rules and principles of the previous regime. Nevertheless,  the political and social reality was that the country was in a process of rapid and profound transformation,  with the population and emerging political forces assuming the values which characterize a Democratic State,  values not yet mirrored in the Constitution. Motives for writing constitutionThis Constitutional Law intends,  then,  to provide the country with a useful framework,  in its text and in its new model.  The option in favor of a Constitution with the basic principles of a pluralistic democracy,  abandoning other governmental options,  will provide stability to a country weak in resources,  and political succession without upheaval. Human dignityAssuming the principle of popular sovereignty,  this Constitutional text consecrates a Democratic State with a vast list of rights,  liberties,  and guarantees to citizens,  the concept of the dignity of the human being as the absolute value which is supreme over the State itself,  a system of government with a balance of power between the various national institutions,  a strong and independent judiciary,  local authorities whose officeholders shall be elected by the communities to whom they are responsible,  a Public Administration at the service of the citizens and conceived as an instrument of development,  and a system of defense of the Constitution characteristic of a pluralistic democracy. Motives for writing constitutionTherefore,  this Constitutional Law incorporates the profound political changes at work in the country and fosters institutional conditions for the exercise of power and of citizenship in a climate of liberty,  peace,  and justice,  the basis of all economic,  social and cultural development in Cape Verde.

Chad 2018,"Source of constitutional authority, Preamble, Motives for writing constitution, Reference to country's historyPreambleChad,  proclaimed a republic on November 28,  1958,  granted national and international sovereignty on August 11,  1960. Since this date,  it has experienced turbulent institutional and political development. Years of dictatorship and of single-party rule prevented the flourishing of any democratic culture and political pluralism. Different successive regimes created and maintained regionalism,  tribalism,  nepotism,  social inequalities,  violations of human rights and of fundamental collective and individual freedoms,  of which the consequences were war,  political violence,  hatred,  intolerance,  and distrust between the different communities which compose the Chadian nation. This institutional and political crisis that has destabilized Chad for more than four decades has only fueled the determination of the Chadian people to achieve the building of one nation,  of dignity,  of freedom,  of peace and of prosperity. Thus,  the Sovereign National Conference,  held at N’Djamena from January 15 to April 7 1993,  at the initiative of the President of the Republic and having assembled the political parties,  the civil society associations,  the organs of the State,  the traditional and religious authorities,  the representatives of the rural world and the resources of leading figures,  have restored confidence to the Chadian people and enabled the advent of a new era. This new era was consecrated in the Constitution of March 31,  1996,  and revised in 2005 and 2013. After two decades of experimentation by institutions deriving from this Constitution,  the Inclusive National Forum held at N’djamena of 19 to 27 March 2018 enabled the bringing of the reforms necessary for the reinforcement of democracy and of the State of Law. The processes of the reforms validated by the People and consecrated by this constitutional law adopt the form of a State strongly decentralized and profoundly modernized the institutions of the State. Regional group(s)Consequently,  We the Chadian People: Human dignity, Reference to fraternity/solidarityAffirm by this Constitution our will to live together with respect for ethnic,  religious,  regional and cultural diversity,  to build a State of law and one united Nation founded on public freedoms and the fundamental rights of Man,  the dignity of the human person and political pluralism,  on the African values of solidarity and fraternity; Affirm our attachment to integrity,  probity,  transparence,  impartiality and accountability as republican and ethical values appropriate to moralize the life of the Nation; Integration of ethnic communitiesConsider that political,  ethnic and religious tolerance,  pardons,  interreligious dialogues and cultural dialogues constitute fundamental values contributing to the consolidation of our national unity and cohesion; Recognize the promotion of gender and youth as factors necessary to realize equality between men and women within our country and recognize the imperative of taking them into account for lasting human development; International organizations, International human rights treaties, International lawReaffirm our commitment to the principles of the Rights of Man as defined by the Charter of the United Nations of 1945,  the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1948 and the African Charter of the Rights of Man and of Peoples of 1981; Right to overthrow governmentSolemnly proclaim our right and our duty to resist and disobey any individual or group of individuals,  and any organs of the State that would take power by force or would exercise it in violation of this Constitution; Affirm our total opposition to any regime of which the policy would be founded on arbitrariness,  dictatorship,  injustice,  corruption,  extortion,  nepotism,  clanism,  tribalism,  denominationalism and the seizure of power; Reference to fraternity/solidarityAffirm our determination to cooperate in peace and goodwill with all peoples sharing our ideals of freedom,  of justice and of solidarity,  based on the principles of equality,  of mutual interests,  of mutual respect and of national sovereignty,  of territorial integrity and of non-interference; Proclaim our dedication to the cause of African unity and our commitment to carry out everything possible to achieve sub-regional and regional integration; Solemnly adopt this Constitution as supreme law of the State.

Palestine 2005,"Reference to country's history, Motives for writing constitution, PreamblePreambleGod or other deitiesIn the Name of God,  the Merciful and the Compassionate. The continuous attachment of the Arab Palestinian people to the land of their fathers and forefathers,  on which this people has historically lived,  is a fact that has been expressed in the Declaration of Independence,  issued by the Palestine National Council.  The strength of this attachment is confirmed by its consistency over time and place,  by keeping faith with and holding onto national identity,  and in the realization of wondrous accomplishments of struggle.  The organic relationship between the Palestinian people,  their history and their land has confirmed itself in their unceasing effort to prompt the world to recognize the rights of the Arab Palestinian people and their national entity,  on equal footing with other nations. The birth of the Palestinian National Authority in the national homeland of Palestine,  the land of their forefathers,  comes within the context of continuous and vigorous struggle,  during which the Palestinian people witnessed thousands of their precious children sacrificed as martyrs,  injured persons and prisoners of war,  all in order to achieve their people’s clear national rights,  the foremost of which are the right of return,  the right to self-determination and the right to establish an independent Palestinian state,  with Jerusalem as a capital,  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization,  the sole,  legitimate representative of the Arab Palestinian people wherever they exist. Within the framework of the interim period,  resulting in the Declaration of Principles Agreement,  the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority with its three pillars - the legislative,  executive and judicial branches - became among the most urgent of national missions.  The establishment of the Palestinian Legislative Council,  through free and direct general elections,  made the adoption of a Basic Law suitable for the interim period a necessary foundation upon which to organize the mutual relationship between the government and the people.  It is a first step on the way to determining the distinguishing characteristics of a civil society capable of achieving its independence.  At the same time,  it is a basic foundation upon which to enact unifying legislation and law for the Palestinian national homeland. This Basic Law has established a firm foundation,  representing the collective conscience of our people,  including its spiritual components,  its national faith and its nationalist loyalty.  The titles of the Basic Law include a group of modern constitutional rules and principles that address public and personal rights and liberties in a manner that achieves justice and equality for all,  without discrimination.  Further,  they ensure the rule of law,  strike a balance between the executive,  legislative and judicial branches,  and draw lines between their respective jurisdictions in a manner that ensures independence to each of them while coordinating their roles to achieve a high national interest that will serve as a guide to all. Right to self determination, Political theorists/figuresThe enactment of this temporary Basic Law for a transitional and interim period constitutes a fundamental step towards the realization of the firm national and historical rights of the Arab Palestinian people.  It shall not in any way whatsoever abrogate or cancel their right to continue to strive to achieve their rights of return and self-determination,  including the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem (al-Quds al-Sharif) as its capital,  which is the first shrine and the third mosque,  to which the Prophet Muhammad,  may peace be upon him,  traveled by night,  in the land of the nativity of Jesus,  may peace be upon him. The provisional character of the Basic Law shall not abrogate the right of any Palestinian,  wherever residing,  to exercise equal rights with his/her fellow citizens on the soil of the homeland. Source of constitutional authorityThis temporary Basic Law draws its strength from the will of the Palestinian people,  their firm rights,  their continuous struggle and the exercise of their democratic right - as represented in the election of the President of the Palestinian National Authority and the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council - to commence the organization and establishment of a sound,  democratic and legislative life in Palestine.  At the same time,  the enactment and ratification of this law by the Legislative Council does spring from the fact that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole and legitimate representative of the Arab Palestinian people.

China 2018,"Political theorists/figures, Preamble, Mentions of social class, Reference to country's historyPreambleChina is one of the countries with the longest histories in the world.  The people of all nationalities in China have jointly created a splendid culture and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Feudal China was gradually reduced after 1840 to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country.  The Chinese people waged wave upon wave of heroic struggles for national independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom.  Great and earth-shaking historical changes have taken place in China in the 20th century.  The Revolution of 1911,  led by Dr.  Sun Yat-sen,  abolished the feudal monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China.  But the Chinese people had yet to fulfill their historical task of overthrowing imperialism and feudalism. After waging hard,  protracted and tortuous struggles,  armed and otherwise,  the Chinese people of all nationalities led by the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader ultimately,  in 1949,  overthrew the rule of imperialism,  feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism,  won the great victory of the New-Democratic Revolution and founded the People's Republic of China.  Thereupon,  the Chinese people took state power into their own hands and became masters of the country. After the founding of the People's Republic,  the transition of Chinese society from a new-democratic to a socialist society was effected step by step.  The socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production was completed,  the system of exploitation of man by man eliminated and the socialist system established.  The people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants,  which is in essence the dictatorship of the proletariat,  has been consolidated and developed.  The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have thwarted aggression,  sabotage and armed provocations by imperialists and hegemonists,  safeguarded China's national independence and security and strengthened its national defense. Reference to scienceMajor successes have been achieved in economic development.  An independent and fairly comprehensive socialist system of industry has in the main been established.  There has been a marked increase in agricultural production.  Significant progress has been made in educational,  scientific,  cultural and other undertakings,  and socialist ideological education has yielded noteworthy results.  The living standards of the people have improved considerably. Reference to scienceThe victory in China's New-Democratic Revolution and the successes in its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people of all nationalities,  under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought,  by upholding truth,  correcting errors and surmounting numerous difficulties and hardships.  China will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come.  The basic task of the nation is to concentrate its effort on socialist modernization along the road of Chinese-style socialism.  Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism,  Mao Zedong Thought,  Deng Xiaoping Theory,  the important thought of Three Represents,  the Scientific Outlook on Development,  and the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,  the Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist road,  persevere in reform and opening to the outside world,  steadily improve socialist institutions,  develop the socialist market economy,  develop socialist democracy,  improve the socialist rule of law,  implement the new development concept,  and work hard and self-reliantly to modernize the country's industry,  agriculture,  national defense and science and technology step by step and promote the coordinated development of the material,  political,  spiritual,  social,  and ecological civilizations,  to turn China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous,  powerful,  democratic,  culturally advanced,  harmonious,  and beautiful and achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The exploiting classes as such have been eliminated in our country.  However,  class struggle will continue to exist within certain limits for a long time to come.  The Chinese people must fight against those forces and elements,  both at home and abroad,  that are hostile to China's socialist system and try to undermine it. Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China.  It is the lofty duty of the entire Chinese people,  including our compatriots in Taiwan,  to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland. In building socialism it is essential to rely on workers,  peasants and intellectuals and to unite all forces that can be united.  In the long years of revolution,  construction and reform,  there has been formed under the leadership of the Communist Party of China a broad patriotic united front which is composed of the democratic parties and people's organizations and which embraces all socialist working people,  all builders of socialism,  all patriots who support socialism,  all patriots who stand for the reunification of the motherland,  and all patriots devoted to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  This united front will continue to be consolidated and developed.  The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,  a broadly based representative organization of the united front which has played a significant historical role,  will play a still more important role in the country's political and social life,  in promoting friendship with other countries and in the struggle for socialist modernization and for the reunification and unity of the country.  The system of the multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China will exist and develop for a long time to come. Integration of ethnic communitiesThe People's Republic of China is a unitary multi-national state built up jointly by the people of all its nationalities.  Socialist relations of equality,  unity,  mutual assistance,  and harmony have been established among the nationalities and will continue to be strengthened.  In the struggle to safeguard the unity of the nationalities,  it is necessary to combat big-nation chauvinism,  mainly Han chauvinism,  and also necessary to combat local-national chauvinism.  The state does its utmost to promote the common prosperity of all nationalities in the country. China's achievements in revolution,  construction,  and reform are inseparable from the support of the people of the world.  The future of China is closely linked to the future of the world.  China consistently carries out an independent foreign policy and adheres to the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,  mutual non-aggression,  non-interference in each other's internal affairs,  equality and mutual benefit,  and peaceful coexistence,  the path of peaceful development,  and the reciprocal opening-up strategy in developing diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges with other countries and prompting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.  China consistently opposes imperialism,  hegemonism and colonialism,  works to strengthen unity with the people of other countries,  supports the oppressed nations and the developing countries in their just struggle to win and preserve national independence and develop their national economies,  and strives to safeguard world peace and promote the cause of human progress.

Iran 1989,"PreamblePreambleGod or other deitiesIn the Name of Allah,  the Compassionate,  the MercifulWe sent aforetime Our apostles with clear signs,  and sent down with them the Book and the Balance that men may uphold justice. . .  (57: 25)The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the cultural,  social,  political,  and economic institutions of Iranian society on the basis of Islamic principles and norms,  which represent the earnest aspiration of the Islamic Ummah.  This basic aspiration was made explicit by the very nature of the great Islamic Revolution of Iran,  as well as the course of the Muslim people's struggle,  from its beginning until victory,  as reflected in the decisive and forceful slogans raised by all segments of the populations.  Now,  at the threshold of this great victory,  our nation,  with all its being,  seeks its fulfilment. Political theorists/figures, Crimes of the previous regime, Reference to country's historyThe basic characteristic of this revolution,  which distinguishes it from other movements that have taken place in Iran during the past hundred years,  is its ideological and Islamic nature.  After experiencing the anti-despotic constitutional movement and the anticolonialist movement centred on the nationalization of the oil industry,  the Muslim people of Iran learned from this costly experience that the obvious and fundamental reason for the failure of those movements was their lack of an ideological basis.  Although the Islamic line of thought and the direction provided by militant religious leaders played an essential role in the recent movements,  nonetheless,  the struggles waged in the course of those movements quickly fell into stagnation due to departure from genuine Islamic positions.  Thus it was that the awakened conscience of the nation,  under the leadership of the eminent marji' al-taqlid,  Ayatullah al-'Uzma Imam Khumaynî,  came to perceive the necessity of pursuing an authentically Islamic and ideological line in its struggles.  And this time,  the militant 'ulama' of the country,  who had always been in the forefront of popular movements,  together with the committed writers and intellectuals,  found new impetus by following his leadership.  (The beginning of the most recent movement of the Iranian people is to be put at 1382 of the lunar Islamic calendar,  corresponding to 1341 of the solar Islamic calendar [1962 of the Christian calendar]). The Dawn of the Movement. Reference to country's history, Political theorists/figures, Crimes of the previous regimeThe devastating protest of Imam Khumaynî against the American conspiracy known as the ""White Revolution"",  which was a step intended to stabilize the foundations of despotic rule and to reinforce the political,  cultural,  and economic dependence of Iran on world imperialism,  brought into being a united movement of the people and,  immediately afterwards,  a momentous revolution of the Muslim nation in the month of Khurdad,  1342 [June 1963].  Although this revolution was drowned in blood,  in reality it heralded the beginning of the blossoming of a glorious and massive uprising,  which confirmed the central role of Imam Khumaynî as an Islamic leader.  Despite his exile from Iran after his protest against the humiliating law of capitulation (which provided legal immunity for American advisers),  the firm bond between the Imam and the people endured,  and the Muslim nation,  particularly committed intellectuals and militant 'ulama',  continued their struggle in the face of banishment and imprisonment,  torture and execution. Throughout this time,  the conscious and responsible segment of society was bringing enlightenment to the people from the strongholds of the mosques,  centres of religious teaching,  and universities.  Drawing inspiration from the revolutionary and fertile teachings of Islam,  they began the unrelenting yet fruitful struggle of raising the level of ideological awareness and revolutionary consciousness of the Muslim people.  The despotic regime which had begun the suppression of the Islamic movement with barbaric attacks on the Faydiyyah Madrasah,  Tehran University,  and all other active centres of revolution,  in an effort to evade the revolutionary anger of the people,  resorted to the most savage and brutal measures.  And in these circumstances,  execution by firing squads,  endurance of medieval tortures,  and long terms of imprisonment were the price our Muslim nation had to pay to prove its firm resolve to continue the struggle.  The Islamic Revolution of Iran was nurtured by the blood of hundreds of young men and women,  infused with faith,  who raised their cries of ""Allahu Akbar"" at daybreak in execution yards,  or were gunned down by the enemy in streets and marketplaces.  Meanwhile,  the continuing declarations and messages of the Imam that were issued on various occasions,  extended and deepened the consciousness and determination of the Muslim nation to the utmost. Islamic Government. Political theorists/figuresThe plan of the Islamic government based upon wilayat al-faqih,  as proposed by Imam Khumaynî at the height of the period of repression and strangulation practised by the despotic regime,  produced a new specific,  and streamlined motive for the Muslim people,  opening up before them the true path of Islamic ideological struggle,  and giving greater intensity to the struggle of militant and committed Muslims both within the country and abroad. The movement continued on this course until finally popular dissatisfaction and intense rage of the public caused by the constantly increasing repression at home,  and the projection of the struggle at the international level after exposure of the regime by the 'ulama' and militant students,  shook the foundations of the regime violently.  The regime and its sponsors were compelled to decrease the intensity of repression and to ""liberalize"" the political atmosphere of the country.  This,  they imagined,  will serve as a safety valve,  which would prevent their eventual downfall.  But the people,  aroused,  conscious,  and resolute under the decisive and unfaltering leadership of the Imam,  embarked on a triumphant,  unified,  comprehensive,  and countrywide uprising. The Wrath of the People. Political theorists/figures, Reference to fraternity/solidarityThe publication of an outrageous article meant to malign the revered 'ulama' and in particular Imam Khumaynî on 15 Day,  1356 [January 7,  1978] by the ruling regime accelerated the revolutionary movement and caused an outburst of popular outrage across the country.  The regime attempted to quell the volcano of the people's anger by drowning the protest and uprising in blood,  but the bloodshed only quickened the pulse rate of the Revolution.  The seventh-day and fortieth-day commemorations of the martyrs of the Revolution,  like a series of steady heartbeats,  gave greater vitality,  intensity,  vigour,  and solidarity to this movement all over the country.  In the course of this popular movement,  the employees of all government establishments took an active part in the effort to overthrow the tyrannical regime by calling a general strike and participating in street demonstrations.  The widespread solidarity of men and women of all segments of society and of all political and religious factions,  played a clearly determining role in the struggle.  Especially the women were actively and massively present in a most conspicuous manner at all stages of this great struggle.  The common sight of mothers with infants in their arms rushing towards the scene of battle and in front of the barrels of machine-guns indicated the essential and decisive role played by this major segment of society in the struggle. The Price the Nation Paid. After slightly more than a year of continuous and unrelenting struggle,  the sapling of the Revolution,  watered by the blood of more than 60, 000 martyrs and 100, 000 wounded and disabled,  not to mention billions of tumans' worth of property damage,  came to bear fruit amidst the cries of ""Independence! Freedom! Islamic government!"" This great movement,  which attained victory through reliance upon faith,  unity,  and the decisiveness of its leadership at every critical and sensitive juncture,  as well as the self-sacrificing spirit of the people,  succeeded in upsetting all the calculations of imperialism and destroying all its connections and institutions,  thereby opening a new chapter in the history of all embracing popular revolutions of the world. Bahman 21 and 22,  1357 [February 12 and 13,  1979] witnessed the collapse of the monarchical regime;  domestic tyranny and foreign domination,  both of which were based upon it,  were shattered.  This great success proved to be the vanguard of Islamic government--a long-cherished desire of the Muslim people--and brought with it the glad tidings of final victory. Unanimously,  and with the participation of the maraji' al-taqlid,  the 'ulama' of Islam,  and the leadership,  the Iranian people declared their final and firm decision,  in the referendum on the Islamic Republic,  to bring about a new political system,  that of the Islamic Republic.  A 98. 2% majority of the people voted for this system.  The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran,  setting forth as it does the political,  social,  cultural,  and economic institutions and their relations that are to exist in society,  must now provide for the consolidation of the foundations of Islamic government,  and propose the plan of a new system of government to be erected on the ruins of the previous taghuti order. The Form of Government in Islam. Motives for writing constitution, Status of religious law, God or other deities, Right to self determinationIn the view of Islam,  government does not derive from the interests of a class,  nor does it serve the domination of an individual or a group.  It represents rather the crystallization of the political ideal of a people who bear a common faith and common outlook,  taking an organized form in order to initiate the process of intellectual and ideological evolution towards the final goal,  i. e. ,  movement towards Allah.  Our nation,  in the course of its revolutionary developments,  has cleansed itself of the dust and impurities that accumulated during the taghuti past and purged itself of foreign ideological influences,  returning to authentic intellectual standpoints and world-view of Islam.  It now intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  The mission of the Constitution is to realize the ideological objectives of the movement and to create conditions conducive to the development of man in accordance with the noble and universal values of Islam. With due attention to the Islamic content of the Iranian Revolution,  which has been a movement aimed at the triumph of all the mustad'afun over the mustakbirun,  the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular,  in the development of international relations,  the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Qur'anic verse ""This your community is a single community,  and I am your Lord,  so worship Me"" [21: 92]),  and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world. Motives for writing constitutionWith due attention to the essential character of this great movement,  the Constitution guarantees the rejection of all forms of intellectual and social tyranny and economic monopoly,  and aims at entrusting the destinies of the people to the people themselves in order to break completely with the system of oppression.  (This is in accordance with the Qur'anic verse ""He removes from them their burdens and the fetters that were upon them"" [7: 157]). Motives for writing constitution, Status of religious lawIn creating,  on the basis of ideological outlook,  the political infrastructures and institutions that are the foundation of society,  the righteous will assume the responsibility of governing and administering the country (in accordance with the Qur'anic verse ""Verily My righteous servants shall inherit the earth"" [21: 105]).  Legislation setting forth regulations for the administration of society will revolve around the Qur'an and the Sunnah.  Accordingly,  the exercise of meticulous and earnest supervision by just,  pious,  and committed scholars of Islam (al-fuqaha' al-'udul) is an absolute necessity.  In addition,  the aim of government is to foster the growth of man in such a way that he progresses towards the establishment of a Divine order (in accordance with the Qur'anic phrase ""And toward God is the journeying"" [3: 28]);  and to create favourable conditions for the emergence and blossoming of man's innate capacities,  so that the theomorphic dimensions of the human being are manifested (in accordance with the injunction of the Prophet (S),  ""Mould yourselves according to the Divine morality"");  this goal cannot be attained without the active and broad participation of all segments of society in the process of social development. Status of religious law, Motives for writing constitutionWith due attention to this goal,  the Constitution provides the basis of such participation by all members of society at all stages of the political decision-making process on which the destiny of the country depends.  In this way,  during the course of human development towards perfection,  each individual will himself be involved in,  and responsible for the growth,  advancement,  and leadership of society.  Precisely in this lies the realization of the government of the mustad'afun upon the earth (in accordance with the Qur'anic verse ""And we wish to show favour to those who have been oppressed upon earth,  and to make them leaders and the inheritors"" [28: 5]). The Wilayah of the Just Faqih. Duty to obey the constitution, Status of religious lawIn keeping with the principles of governance [wilayat al-'amr] and the perpetual necessity of leadership [imamah],  the Constitution provides for the establishment of leadership by a faqih possessing the necessary qualifications [jami' al-shara'it. ] and recognized as leader by the people (this is in accordance with the hadith ""The direction of [public] affairs is in the hands of those who are learned concerning God and are trustworthy in matters pertaining to what He permits and forbids"" [Tuhaf al-'uqul,  p.  176]).  Such leadership will prevent any deviation by the various organs of State from their essential Islamic duties. The Economy is a Means Not an End. In strengthening the foundations of the economy,  the fundamental consideration will be fulfillment of the material needs of man in the course of his overall growth and development.  This principle contrasts with other economic systems,  where the aim is concentration and accumulation of wealth and maximization of profit.  In materialist schools of thought,  the economy represents an end in itself,  so that it comes to be a subversive and corrupting factor in the course of man's development.  In Islam,  the economy is a means,  and all that is required of a means is that it should be an efficient factor contributing to the attainment of the ultimate goal. Right to workFrom this viewpoint,  the economic programme of Islam consists of providing the means needed for the emergence of the various creative capacities of the human being.  Accordingly,  it is the duty of the Islamic government to furnish all citizens with equal and appropriate opportunities,  to provide them with work,  and to satisfy their essential needs,  so that the course of their progress may be assured. Woman in the Constitution. Through the creation of Islamic social infrastructures,  all the elements of humanity that hitherto served the multifaceted foreign exploitation shall regain their true identity and human rights.  As a part of this process,  it is only natural that women should benefit from a particularly large augmentation of their rights,  because of the greater oppression that they suffered under the taghuti regime. The family is the fundamental unit of society and the main centre for the growth and edification of human being.  Compatibility with respect to belief and ideal,  which provides the primary basis for man's development and growth,  is the main consideration in the establishment of a family.  It is the duty of the Islamic government to provide the necessary facilities for the attainment of this goal.  This view of the family unit delivers woman from being regarded as an object or as an instrument in the service of promoting consumerism and exploitation.  Not only does woman recover thereby her momentous and precious function of motherhood,  rearing of ideologically committed human beings,  she also assumes a pioneering social role and becomes the fellow struggler of man in all vital areas of life.  Given the weighty responsibilities that woman thus assumes,  she is accorded in Islam great value and nobility. An Ideological Army. In the formation and equipping of the country's defence forces,  due attention must be paid to faith and ideology as the basic criteria.  Accordingly,  the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps are to be organized in conformity with this goal,  and they will be responsible not only for guarding and preserving the frontiers of the country,  but also for fulfilling the ideological mission of jihad in God's way;  that is,  extending the sovereignty of God's law throughout the world (this is in accordance with the Qur'anic verse ""Prepare against them whatever force you are able to muster,  and strings of horses,  striking fear into the enemy of God and your enemy,  and others besides them"" [8: 60]). The Judiciary in the Constitution. Status of religious law, Duty to obey the constitutionThe judiciary is of vital importance in the context of safeguarding the rights of the people in accordance with the line followed by the Islamic movement,  and the prevention of deviations within the Islamic nation.  Provision has therefore been made for the creation of a judicial system based on Islamic justice and operated by just judges with meticulous knowledge of the Islamic laws.  This system,  because of its essentially sensitive nature and the need for full ideological conformity,  must be free from every kind of unhealthy relation and connection (this is in accordance with the Qur'anic verse ""When you judge among the people,  judge with justice"" [4: 58]). Executive Power. Considering the particular importance of the executive power in implementing the laws and ordinances of Islam for the sake of establishing the rule of just relations over society,  and considering,  too,  its vital role in paving the way for the attainment of the ultimate goal of life,  the executive power must work toward the creation of an Islamic society.  Consequently,  the confinement of the executive power within any kind of complex and inhibiting system that delays or impedes the attainment of this goal is rejected by Islam.  Therefore,  the system of bureaucracy,  the result and product of taghuti forms of government,  will be firmly cast away,  so that an executive system that functions efficiently and swiftly in the fulfilment of its administrative commitments comes into existence. MassCommunication Media. Human dignityThe mass-communication media,  radio and television,  must serve the diffusion of Islamic culture in pursuit of the evolutionary course of the Islamic Revolution.  To this end,  the media should be used as a forum for healthy encounter of different ideas,  but they must strictly refrain from diffusion and propagation of destructive and anti-Islamic practices.  It is incumbent on all to adhere to the principles of this Constitution,  for it regards as its highest aim the freedom and dignity of the human race and provides for the growth and development of the human being.  It is also necessary that the Muslim people should participate actively in the construction of Islamic society by selecting competent and believing [mu'min] officials and keeping close and constant watch on their performance.  They may then hope for success in building an ideal Islamic society that can be a model for all people of the world and a witness to its perfection (in accordance with the Qur'anic verse ""Thus We made you a median community,  that you might be witnesses to men"" [2: 143]). Representatives. The Assembly of Experts,  composed of representatives of the people,  completed its task of framing the Constitution,  on the basis of the draft proposed by the government as well as all the proposals received from different groups of the people,  in one hundred and seventy-five articles arranged in twelve chapters,  on the eve of the fifteenth century after the migration of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his Family),  the founder of the redeeming school of Islam,  and in accordance with the aims and aspirations set out above,  with the hope that this century will witness the establishment of a universal government of the mustad'afun and the downfall of all the mustakbirun.

In addition to what is laid down in paragraph one,  everyone shall be protected in their relations with the public institutions against significant invasions of their personal privacy,  if these occur without their consent and involve the surveillance or systematic monitoring of the individual's personal circumstances. Art 7No Swedish citizen may be deported from or refused entry into the Realm. Conditions for revoking citizenshipNo Swedish citizen who is domiciled in the Realm or who has previously been domiciled in the Realm may be deprived of his or her citizenship.

All Swedish citizens shall also in other respects be guaranteed freedom of movement within the Realm and freedom to depart the Realm. Part 3.  Rule of lawArt 9Protection from unjustified restraint, Right to speedy trialIf a public authority other than a court of law has deprived an individual of his or her liberty on account of a criminal act or because he or she is suspected of having committed such an act,  the individual shall be entitled to have the deprivation of liberty examined before a court of law without undue delay.  This shall not,  however,  apply where the matter concerns the transfer to Sweden of responsibility for executing a penal sanction involving deprivation of liberty according to a sentence in another state. Protection from unjustified restraintAlso those who for reasons other than those specified in paragraph one,  have been taken forcibly into custody,  shall likewise be entitled to have the matter of custody examined before a court of law without undue delay.  In such a case,  examination before a tribunal shall be equated with examination before a court of law,  provided the composition of the tribunal has been laid down in law and it is stipulated that the chair of the tribunal shall be currently,  or shall have been previously,  a permanent salaried judge. If examination has not been referred to an authority which is competent under paragraph one or two,  such examination shall be undertaken by a court of general jurisdiction. Art 10Protection from ex post facto lawsNo one may be sentenced to a penalty or penal sanction for an act which was not subject to a penal sanction at the time it was committed.

The provisions laid down here with respect to penal sanctions also apply to forfeiture and other special legal effects of crime. No taxes or charges due the State may be imposed except inasmuch as this follows from provisions which were in force when the circumstance arose which occasioned the liability for the tax or charge.  Should the Riksdag find that special reasons so warrant,  it may however lay down in law that taxes or charges due the State shall be imposed even though no such act had entered into force when the aforementioned circumstance arose,  provided the Government,  or a committee of the Riksdag,  had submitted a proposal to this effect to the Riksdag at the time concerned.  A written communication from the Government to the Riksdag announcing the forthcoming introduction of such a proposal is equated with a formal proposal.  The Riksdag may furthermore prescribe that exceptions shall be made to the provisions of sentence one if it considers that this is warranted on special grounds connected with war,  the danger of war,  or grave economic crisis. Art 11No court of law may be established on account of an act already committed,  or for a particular dispute or otherwise for a particular case. Right to speedy trial, Right to public trial, Right to fair trialLegal proceedings are to be carried out fairly and within a reasonable period of time.

Equality regardless of genderArt 13No act of law or other provision may imply the unfavourable treatment of anyone on grounds of gender,  unless the provision forms part of efforts to promote equality between men and women or relates to compulsory military service or other equivalent official duties. Right to strikeArt 14A trade union or an employer or employers' association shall be entitled to take industrial action unless otherwise provided in an act of law or under an agreement. Part 5.  Protection of property and the right of public accessArt 15Protection from expropriation, Right to own propertyThe property of every individual shall be so guaranteed that no one may be compelled by expropriation or other such disposition to surrender property to the public institutions or to a private subject,  or tolerate restriction by the public institutions of the use of land or buildings,  other than where necessary to satisfy pressing public interests. Protection from expropriationA person who is compelled to surrender property by expropriation or other such disposition shall be guaranteed full compensation for his or her loss.  Compensation shall also be guaranteed to a person whose use of land or buildings is restricted by the public institutions in such a manner that on-going land use in the affected part of the property is substantially impaired,  or injury results which is significant in relation to the value of that part of the property.  Compensation shall be determined according to principles laid down in law. In the case of limitations on the use of land or buildings on grounds of protection of human health or the environment,  or on grounds of safety,  however,  the rules laid down in law apply in the matter of entitlement to compensation. Everyone shall have access to the natural environment in accordance with the right of public access,  notwithstanding the above provisions. Part 6.  CopyrightReference to art, Provisions for intellectual propertyArt 16Authors,  artists and photographers shall own the rights to their works in accordance with rules laid down in law. Part 7.  Freedom of tradeArt 17Right to choose occupationLimitations affecting the right to trade or practise a profession may be introduced only in order to protect pressing public interests and never solely in order to further the economic interests of a particular person or enterprise.

Education and researchArt 18Free education, Compulsory educationAll children covered by compulsory schooling shall be entitled to a free basic education in the public education system.  The public institutions shall be responsible also for the provision of higher education. The freedom of research is protected according to rules laid down in law. Part 9.

Part 10.

Freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate may similarly be limited also in cases under Article 24,  paragraph one,  sentence two. Art 21The limitations referred to in Article 20 may be imposed only to satisfy a purpose acceptable in a democratic society.  The limitation must never go beyond what is necessary with regard to the purpose which occasioned it,  nor may it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the free shaping of opinion as one of the fundaments of democracy.  No limitation may be imposed solely on grounds of a political,  religious,  cultural or other such opinion. Art 22A draft law under Article 20 shall be held in abeyance,  unless rejected by the Riksdag,  for a minimum of twelve months from the date on which the first Riksdag committee report on the proposal was submitted to the Chamber,  if so moved by at least ten members.  The Riksdag may,  however,  adopt the proposal directly if it has the support of at least five sixths of those voting. Paragraph one shall not apply to any draft law prolonging the life of a law for a period not exceeding two years.  Nor shall it apply to any draft law concerned only with: prohibition of the disclosure of matters which have come to a person's knowledge in the performance of public or official duties,  where secrecy is called for with regard to interests under Chapter 2,  Article 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act; house searches and similar invasions of privacy;  ordeprivation of liberty as a penal sanction for a specific act.

Freedom of expression may also be limited in business activities.  Freedom of expression and freedom of information may otherwise be limited only where particularly important grounds so warrant. In judging what limitations may be introduced in accordance with paragraph one,  particular attention must be paid to the importance of the widest possible freedom of expression and freedom of information in political,  religious,  professional,  scientific and cultural matters. The adoption of provisions which regulate in more detail a particular manner of disseminating or receiving information,  without regard to its content,  shall not be deemed a limitation of the freedom of expression or the freedom of information. Art 24Freedom of assemblyFreedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate may be limited in the interests of preserving public order and public safety at a meeting or demonstration,  or with regard to the circulation of traffic.  These freedoms may otherwise be limited only with regard to the security of the Realm or in order to combat an epidemic. Freedom of associationFreedom of association may be limited only in respect of organisations whose activities are of a military or quasi-military nature,  or constitute persecution of a population group on grounds of ethnic origin,  colour,  or other such conditions.

The RiksdagPart 1.  Formation and composition of the RiksdagArt 1First chamber selection, Secret ballotThe Riksdag is appointed by means of free,  secret and direct elections. First chamber selectionVoting in such elections is by party,  with an option for the voter to express a personal preference vote. Party denotes any association or group of voters which runs for election under a particular designation. Size of first chamber, Structure of legislative chamber(s)Art 2The Riksdag consists of a single chamber comprising three hundred and forty-nine members.  Alternates shall be appointed for members. Part 2.  Ordinary electionsTerm length for first chamberArt 3Ordinary elections to the Riksdag are held every four years. Part 3.  Right to vote and eligibility to stand for electionArt 4Claim of universal suffrage, Restrictions on votingEvery Swedish citizen who is currently domiciled within the Realm or who has ever been domiciled within the Realm,  and who has reached the age of eighteen,  is entitled to vote in an election to the Riksdag. Eligibility for first chamber, Minimum age for first chamberOnly a person who is entitled to vote may be a member or alternate member of the Riksdag. Restrictions on votingThe question of whether a person has the right to vote is determined on the basis of an electoral roll drawn up prior to the election. Part 4.  ConstituenciesElectoral districtsArt 5The Realm is divided up into constituencies for the purpose of elections to the Riksdag. Part 5.  Distribution of seats among constituenciesFirst chamber selectionArt 6Size of first chamberOf the seats in the Riksdag,  310 are fixed constituency seats and 39 are adjustment seats. The fixed constituency seats are distributed among the constituencies on the basis of a calculation of the relationship between the number of persons entitled to vote in each constituency,  and the total number of persons entitled to vote throughout the whole of the Realm.  The distribution of seats among the constituencies is determined for four years at a time. Part 6.  Distribution of seats among partiesFirst chamber selectionArt 7The seats are distributed among parties. Eligibility for first chamberOnly parties which receive at least four per cent of the votes cast throughout the  Realm may share in the distribution of seats.  A party receiving fewer votes,  however,  participates in the distribution of the fixed constituency seats in a constituency in which it receives at least twelve per cent of the votes cast. First chamber selectionArt 8The fixed constituency seats in each constituency are distributed proportionately among the parties on the basis of the election result in that constituency. The adjustment seats are distributed among the parties in such a way that the distribution of all the seats in the Riksdag,  other than those fixed constituency seats which have been allocated to a party polling less than four per cent of the national vote,  is in proportion to the total number of votes cast throughout the Realm for the respective parties participating in the distribution of seats.  If,  in the distribution of the fixed constituency seats,  a party obtains seats which exceed the number corresponding to the proportional representation of that party in the Riksdag,  then that party and the fixed constituency seats which it has obtained are disregarded in distributing the adjustment seats.  The adjustment seats are allocated to constituencies after they have been distributed among the parties. The odd-number method is used to distribute the seats among the parties,  with the first divisor adjusted to 1. 4. First chamber selectionArt 9One member is appointed for each seat a party obtains,  together with an alternate for that member. Part 7.  Electoral periodArt 10Each election is valid for the period from the date on which the newly-elected Riksdag convenes to the date on which the Riksdag elected next thereafter convenes.

Extraordinary electionsDismissal of the legislatureArt 11The Government may decide that an extraordinary election to the Riksdag is to be held between ordinary elections.  An extraordinary election is held within three months from the decision. After an election to the Riksdag has been held,  the Government may not hold an extraordinary election until three months from the date on which the newly-elected Riksdag first convened.  Neither may the Government decide to hold an extraordinary election while ministers remain at their posts,  after all have been formally discharged,  pending assumption of office by a new Government. Rules concerning an extraordinary election in a particular case are laid down in Chapter 6,  Article 5. Part 9.  Appeals against election resultsArt 12Appeals against elections to the Riksdag shall be lodged with an Election Review Board appointed by the Riksdag.  There is no right of appeal against a decision of the Board. A person who has been elected a member of the Riksdag exercises his or her mandate even if the election result has been appealed.  If the result of the election is revised,  a new member takes his or her seat immediately after the revised result has been declared.  This applies in a similar manner to alternate members. The Election Review Board consists of a chair,  who is currently,  or has been previously,  a permanent salaried judge and who may not be a member of the Riksdag,  and six other members.  The members are elected after each ordinary election,  as soon as the result of the election becomes final,  and serve until a new election for the Board is held.  The chair is elected separately.

Art 11Members of the Riksdag or alternates for such members may not resign their mandate without the Riksdag's consent. Removal of individual legislatorsWhere there are grounds,  the Election Review Board shall examine on its own initiative whether a particular member or an alternate is eligible under Chapter 3,  Article 4,  paragraph two.  A person pronounced to be ineligible is thereby deprived of his or her mandate. Removal of individual legislatorsMembers or alternates may be deprived of their mandate in cases other than cases under paragraph two only if they have proved themselves manifestly unfit to hold a mandate by reason of a criminal act.  A decision in such a case shall be taken by a court of law. Immunity of legislatorsArt 12Legal proceedings may not be initiated against a person who holds a mandate as a member of the Riksdag,  or who has held such a mandate,  on account of a statement or an act made in the exercise of his or her mandate,  unless the Riksdag has given its consent thereto in a decision supported by at least five sixths of those voting. Nor may such a person be deprived of his or her liberty,  or restricted from travelling within the Realm,  on account of an act or statement made in the exercise of his or her mandate,  unless the Riksdag has given such consent thereto. If,  in any other case,  a member of the Riksdag is suspected of having committed a criminal act,  the relevant legal provisions concerning apprehension,  arrest or detention are applied only if he or she admits guilt or was caught in the act,  or the minimum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for two years. Art 13During such time as a member is acting as Speaker of the Riksdag or is a member of the Government,  his or her mandate as a member shall be exercised by an alternate.

Baden 1818,"Preamble, Reference to country's history, Source of constitutional authority, Motives for writing constitutionPreamblePolitical theorists/figures, God or other deitiesCarl,  by the grace of God,  Grand Duke of Baden,  Duke of Zähringen,  etc. As we already repeatedly made known to our subjects in the year 1816,  we want to give the Grand Duchy an Estates constitution.  Therefore we fostered the desire and the hope that all the members of our federation would come to an agreement regarding this constitution,  through the establishment of an unalterable and fundamental foundation,  assured for all German people.  Only through the further development of the established fundamental laws may a single State continue to create its own laws for its own particular needs,  with continued consideration for existing relations. Due,  however,  to the fact that even after the last vote regarding this matter during the federal assembly the point in time remains to be seen in which the creation of the Estates constitution shall become a matter of collaborative consultation,  We see Ourselves as even more determined to begin fulfilling our promise to Our subjects in ways that are in accordance with Our free and determined inner conviction. Infused with the most earnest desire to tie the band of trust between Us and Our people ever more securely,  and to bring all of our State establishments closer to perfection on the trail that We are blazing,  We have written the following constitutional charter,  and solemnly promise for Us and Our successors that We will uphold and have her upheld loyally and conscientiously.

Egypt 2019,"PreamblePreambleGod or other deitiesIn the Name of God,  Most Gracious,  Most MercifulThis is Our ConstitutionEgypt is the gift of the Nile and the gift of Egyptians to humanity. Blessed with a unique location and history,  the Arab nation of Egypt is the heart of the whole world.  It is the meeting point of its civilizations and cultures and the crossroads of its maritime transportation and communications.  It is the tip of Africa on the Mediterranean and the estuary of its greatest river:  the Nile. This is Egypt,  an immortal homeland to Egyptians,  and a message of peace and love to all peoples. Reference to country's historyIn the beginning of history,  the dawn of human conscience rose and shone forth in the hearts of our great ancestors,  uniting their good intention to build the first central state that regulated and organized the life of Egyptians on the banks of the Nile.  It is where they created the most amazing wonders of civilization,  and where their hearts looked up to the heavens before earth knew the three revealed religions. Egypt is the cradle of religions and the banner of glory of the revealed religions. God or other deitiesOn its land,  Moses grew up,  the light of God appeared,  and the message descended on Mount Sinai. On its land,  Egyptians welcomed Virgin Mary and her baby and offered up thousands of martyrs in defense of the Church of Jesus. God or other deitiesWhen the Seal of the Messengers Mohamed (Peace and Blessings Be Upon Him) was sent to all mankind to perfect the sublime morals,  our hearts and minds were opened to the light of Islam.  We were the best soldiers on Earth to fight for the cause of God,  and we disseminated the message of truth and religious sciences across the world. This is Egypt;  a homeland that we live in as much as it lives in us. Human dignity, Political theorists/figures, Reference to science, Reference to country's historyIn the modern age,  minds were enlightened,  humanity became mature,  and nations and peoples progressed on the path of science,  raising the banners of freedom and equality.  Mohamed Ali founded the modern Egyptian state with a national army as its pillar.  Refaa,  the son of Al-Azhar,  prayed that the homeland become ""a place of common happiness for its people. "" We,  Egyptians,  strived to keep up with the pace of development,  and offered up martyrs and made sacrifices in several uprisings and revolutions until our patriotic army delivered victory to the sweeping popular will in the “Jan 25 – June 30” Revolution that called for bread,  freedom and human dignity within a framework of social justice,  and brought back the homeland’s free will. Reference to country's history, Political theorists/figuresThis revolution is but an extension to a process of national struggle whose brightest symbols were Ahmed Oraby,  Mostafa Kamel,  and Mohamed Farid.  It was the capstone of two great revolutions in our modern history: Reference to country's history, Political theorists/figuresThe 1919 revolution that had rid Egypt and the Egyptians of the British guardianship,  and had established the principle of citizenship and equality between the people of the same country.  Its leader,  Saad Zaghloul,  and his successor,  Mosfata El-Nahhas,  walked the path of democracy,  asserting that “Truth is above power and the nation is above the government”.  During this revolution,  Talaat Harb laid down the cornerstone of the national economy. Political theorists/figures, Reference to country's history, Regional group(s)The July 23,  1952 revolution that was led by the leader Gamal Abdel Nasser and was embraced by the popular will achieved the dream of generations for evacuation and independence.  As a result,  Egypt affirmed its Arab allegiance,  opened up to its African continent and Muslim world,  supported liberation movements across continents,  and took firm steps on the path of development and social justice. Reference to country's history, Political theorists/figuresThis revolution represents an extension of the revolutionary march of Egyptian patriotism,  and supports the strong bond between the Egyptian people and their patriotic army that bore the trust and responsibility of protecting the homeland.  Thanks to it,  we achieved victory in our greatest battles including driving off the 1956 Tripartite Aggression and the glorious victory of October that granted President Sadat a special place in our recent history. Reference to country's historyCompared to major revolutions in the history of mankind,  the Jan 25 – June 30 Revolution is a unique revolution,  because of the heavy popular participation involved -- which was estimated to be in the tens of millions -- and the significant role of youth who aspire to a brighter future,  the masses who transcended class and ideology to reach out to more expansive patriotic and human horizons,  the manner in which the people’s army protected the popular will and the blessings granted to it by Al-Azhar and the patriotic church.  It is also unique because of its peacefulness and ambition to achieve freedom and social justice together. Reference to country's historyThis revolution is a sign and a good omen.  It is a sign of a past that is still present and a good omen of a future to which all humanity aspires. Reference to country's history, God or other deitiesThe world has almost forgotten about an age that was torn by conflicts of interest between the east and the west,  and the north and the south;  an age where disputes and wars erupted between classes and peoples,  where risks grew,  threatening the existence of mankind and life on Earth,  which God created for us.  Humanity hopes to move from the age of maturity to the age of wisdom to build a new world where truth and justice prevail,  and where freedoms and human rights are protected.  We,  Egyptians,  believe that our revolution is an opportunity to return to help write a new history for mankind. We believe that we are capable of using the past as an inspiration,  stirring up the present,  and making our way to the future.  We are capable of developing this homeland that develops us. We believe that every citizen is entitled to live in this homeland in safety and security,  and that every citizen is entitled to a today and a tomorrow. Human dignityWe believe in democracy as a path,  a future,  and a way of life;  in political multiplicity;  and in the peaceful transfer of power.

Bavaria 1808,"Source of constitutional authority, PreamblePreamblePolitical theorists/figures, Name/structure of executive(s), God or other deitiesWe Maximilian Joseph,  by the grace of God,  King of Bavaria. Motives for writing constitution, Reference to country's historyWe are governed by the conviction that as long as the State remains a mere aggregate of separate parts,  it can neither achieve its full potential strength,  for which it has the means,  nor can the individual members aim to impart upon themselves all the advantages of civil union.  We have sought already through many ordinances to eliminate the differences in the administrative systems in our Kingdom,  as far as it was possible beforehand,  to establish a more uniform system for direct and indirect obligations,  and to make the most important public institutions of the collective more equivalent,  through establishments that at the same time ensure their distinctiveness.  Furthermore,  in order to obtain the advantage of just and equal civil and criminal laws for our collective states,  we have also arranged the preliminary work necessary for achieving this goal,  which in part has actually already been completed.  Due,  however,  to the fact that these individual developments of particular parts of the institution of the State do not lead to the perfect consummation of our purpose,  and leave behind gaps,  whose filling is an integral requirement for the necessary unity of the whole Kingdom,  we have decided to give all of the components of the legislature and administration of our Kingdom complete coherency,  through organic laws,  with consideration for both foreign and interior relations.  We have decided to establish the basis for this coherency through the present constitutional charter,  whose purpose is to guarantee the fulfillment of the demands of the State on its individual members,  as well as the demands of the individual members on the State,  through the appropriate ordinances and regulations.  These demands are just and founded in the concept of the general purpose of the State.  This shall provide the whole Kingdom a firm relationship and bond,  and give each of the components of the administration of the State its own appropriate efficacy.  All of this shall be accomplished with the goal of meeting the requirements necessary for securing collective wellness. We regulate and ordain according to the following: "

East Timor 2002,"Motives for writing constitution, Preamble, Reference to country's historyPreambleThe independence of East Timor,  proclaimed by the Frente Revolucionária of Independent East Timor (FRETILIN) on November 28,  1975,  is internationally recognized on May 20,  2002,  following the liberation of the Timorese people from the colonization and occupation of the Maubere Motherland by foreign powers. The elaboration and adoption of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor is the culmination of the secular resistance of the Timorese People intensified following the invasion of December 7,  1975. The struggle waged against the enemy,  initially under the leadership of FRETILIN,  gave way to more comprehensive forms of political participation,  particularly in the wake of the establishment of the National Council of the Maubere Resistance (CNRT) in 1987 and the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT) in 1998. The Resistance was divided into three fronts. The armed front was carried out by the glorious Forças Armadas de Libertação Nacional de Timor-Leste (FALINTIL) whose historical undertaking is to be praised. The action of the clandestine front,  astutely unleashed in hostile territory,  involved the sacrifice of thousands of lives of women and men,  especially the youth,  who fought with abnegation for freedom and independence. The diplomatic front,  harmoniously carried out all over the world,  enabled the opening of the way for definitive liberation. In its cultural and humane perspective,  the Catholic Church in East Timor has always been able to take on the suffering of all the People with dignity,  placing itself on their side in the defense of their most elementary rights. Ultimately,  the present Constitution represents a heart-felt tribute to all martyrs of the Motherland. Thus,  the Members of the Constituent Assembly,  as the legitimate representatives of the People,  were elected on August 30,  2001.
